# Hi. Welcome to my GitHub!

## I’m Flemming Kondrup, a final year Honours Student at McGill University, Canada.

I am awed by the difference AI can make in medicine, in the lives of patients, and want to push the boundaries of this field.

I have experience in clinical data analysis and machine learning, with a particular interest in deep neural networks.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas! flemming.kondrup@mail.mcgill.ca
