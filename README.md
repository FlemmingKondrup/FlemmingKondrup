# Hi. Welcome to my GitHub!

## I’m Flemming Kondrup, a final year Honours Student at McGill University, Canada.

I am awed by the difference computer science can make in the field of medicine and want to push the boundaries of this combination.

I have experience in clinical data analysis and machine learning, with a particular interest in deep neural networks.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas! flemming.kondrup@mail.mcgill.ca
