# Hi. Welcome to my GitHub!

## Iâ€™m Flemming Kondrup, a PhD Student @ Mila & McGill University, Canada.

My main areas of interest are Reinforcement Learning (RL) and ML for Healthcare. Through my work, I aim to develop medical support tools for decision making in health, with a specific interest on optimizing treatments in Intensive Care Units (ICUs).
